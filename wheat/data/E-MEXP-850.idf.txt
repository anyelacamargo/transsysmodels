Experiment Description	A transcriptomic time-course study was performed on the senescence process in flag leaves of the spring wheat cultivar Bobwhite grown in the green-house. Leaf samples were harvested at eight time-points from the time of ear emergence until 50% yellowing of the harvested leaf sample.

Protocol Description	Wheat plants were grown in the green house, in 10x10 cm pots containing a 50:50 peat perlite mixture. Artificial illumination was used for supplementation and for ensuring a day/night cycle of 16/8 hours	Plant material was ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen using mortar and pestle, and RNA was isolated from approx. 2 x 200 µg of this material using oligodT25-Dynabeads (610-05, Dynal, N),  essentially following the recommendations by the manufacturer:  First, the material was homogenized in 1.5 ml binding/lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 M LiCl, 10mM EDTA, 1% LiDS, 5 mM DDT) in 2 ml microtubes. Particulate material was sedimented by centrifugation (3-5 min) and the supernatant was mixed with beads from 200 µl Dynabeads stock solution. Annealing of polyA+-RNA to the beads was allowed for 5-10 min at room temperature followed by a wash in buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.15 M LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% LiDS). To increase the amount of annealed polyA+-RNA, the washed beads were mixed with a second batch of extraction from 200 µg ground plant material. Following the second annealing the beads were washed once in buffer A, twice in buffer B (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.15 M LiCl, 1 mM EDTA), and three times in ice-cold  RT wash buffer (55 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 82.5 mM KCl). The polyA RNA was not eluted from the beads, in stead cDNA was produced on the beads (see 	Dynabeads with captured mRNA that had been washed three times in ice-cold  RT wash buffer (55 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 82.5 mM KCl) were resuspended in 30 µl of reverse transcription reaction mixture (200 U SuperscriptII (InVitrogen), 40 U RNaseOUT (InVitrogen), 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.625 mM dNTP, 10 mM DDT). Following incubation for 1 h at 42°C, with the tubes placed horizontally in a rotary oven, the beads were washed twice in 300 µl TE (10:1) at room temperature and incubated 6 min at 95°C in 300 µl TE (10:1) to remove the RNA from the immobilized cDNA. For  second strand synthesis, the cDNA beads were re-suspended in 24.5 µl of water and 4 µl of random nonamer primer solution (50 µM), incubated 3 min at 95°C, and annealed at room temperature 5-10 min. Then 12.6 µl second strand reaction mixture (10 U Klenow DNA polymerase I large fragment (EP0052, Fermentas, LT); 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0;  0.5 mM dATP, dCTP, and dGTP; 0.16 mM dTTP; 0.33 mM amino-allyl dUTP (A-21664, Molecular Probes, USA)) was added, and incubation was performed for 1 h at 37°C, with the tubes placed horizontally in a rotary oven to keep beads in suspension. The reaction mixture was discarded and the beads were washed twice in 300 µl wash buffer BX (0.1 M phophate buffer pH 7.5, 1 x SSC). Then the beads were resuspended in 40 µl of water and incubated 5 min at 95°C to elute second strand products. The supernatant was immediately recovered and kept on ice. The second strand synthesis from the immobilized cDNA on the beads was repeated and the cDNA concentration in the combined 80 µl amino-allyl-cDNA was estimated spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. Subsequently the product was vacuum dried (at 30°C) and re-dissolved in 10 µl of 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer pH 9.0. The content of one vial of Cy3 or Cy5 NHS esters (RPN5661, Amersham Bioscience, UK) was dissolved in 2 µl of DMSO (D8418, Sigma), and the amino allyl-cDNA was immediately added and mixed with the dye. The mixture was incubated 1 h in the dark at room temperature, and subsequently 38 µl of 100mM sodium acetate, pH 5.2, was added. From this solution the labelled cDNA was purified using the QiaQuick PCR purification kit (28104, Qiagen, D) according to the manufacturers recommendations. Final elution from the columns was performed twice with 40 µl elution buffer. The full sample was used for spectrophotometrical estimation in a 50 µl quartz cuvette of the cDNA amount (from 260 nm readings) and Cy3 and Cy5 amounts (from 550 nm and 650 nm reading, respectively).	Dynabeads with captured mRNA that had been washed three times in ice-cold  RT wash buffer (55 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 82.5 mM KCl) were resuspended in 30 µl of reverse transcription reaction mixture (200 U SuperscriptII (InVitrogen), 40 U RNaseOUT (InVitrogen), 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.625 mM dNTP, 10 mM DDT).

The full sample was used for spectrophotometrical estimation in a 50 µl quartz cuvette of the cDNA amount (from 260 nm readings) and Cy3 and Cy5 amounts (from 550 nm and 650 nm reading, respectively).	Prior to hybridisation the spotted slides were blocked in succinic anhydride according to Eisen and Brown (1999). Following denaturation for 3 min in boiling water, the slides were then rinsed briefly in water and spin-dried in 50 ml tubes in a swing-out centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 6-8 min. The cDNA target solution was prepared from 25 pmol of Cy3 and Cy5 labelled cDNA, respectively, which were combined, vacuum dried, re-dissolved in 5 µl of water, and combined with 40 µl of QMT hybridisation solution (S230010, Quantifoil, D). Prior to addition to the slide, the target hybridisation solution was denatured for 2 min at 95°C. A LifterSlip (25x60I-2-4789, Erie Scientific Company, USA) was placed over the spotted area of the slide, and the target hybridisation solution was allowed to wick accross the space created by the LifterSlip. The slide was placed in a closed hybridisation box containing a few ml of 0.5 x SSC to keep high humidity, and incubation was performed for 16 h in a water bath at 42°C. The LifterSlip was removed in 2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS, and the slides were washed once in 2 x SSC, 0.2% SDS, preheated to 55°C, for 10 min; twice in 0.1 x SSC, 0.1% SDS, preheated to 55°C, for 10 min; and twice in 0.1 x SSC for 1-2 min. The slide was transferred to a 50 ml tube and  immediately spin-dried in a swing-out centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 6-8 min.	Scanning was performed on an arrayWoRx microarray scanner (BioChipReader, Applied Precision, USA), which is a CCD camera-based microarray scanner. Exposure settings were optimised for each slide. Quantification of hybridisation signals was performed using the arrayWoRx 2.0 Software Suite of the scanner. The spot grids for quantification were aligned manually with the spots for each slide.
